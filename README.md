# NYC Cities Bike Analysis



Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we want to format our story so it's persuasive! We'll also want to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.
